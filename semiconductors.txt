# 설명
✔ More Moore, More than Moore, Beyond CMOS 등 다양한 전공정 기술 패러다임을  IRDS(International Roadmap for Devices and Systems) 기반으로 단기(~15년)와 장기(~25년)로 나누어 전망하고, 미래반도체 패키징 방법에 대해서 HIR (Heterogeneous Integration Roadmap)을 기반으로 논의합니다. 미래 반도체 핵심 아키텍쳐인 AI, 양자컴퓨팅, 병렬-직렬 연계, 전자-광-방열 연계에 대한 주요 기술적인 고려사항을 검토됩니다. 이를 통해 연산 속도를 향상시키면서 다양한 기능을 통합하는 미래 반도체 엔지니어링 아키텍처에 대해 직관적으로 비전을 제시합니다.
✔ Based on IRDS (International Roadmap for Devices and Systems), various front-end-of-line process technology paradigms such as More Moore, More than Moore, and Beyond CMOS are divided into short-term (~15 years) and long-term (~25 years) forecasts after reviewing  the current status of semiconductor industries, and back-end-of-line processes are reviewed and forecasted based on HIR (Heterogeneous Integration Roadmap).  Technical requirements and key considerations for prospected alternatives suh as quantum computing, parallel-serial linkage, novel materials, and electron-photon-heat dissipation linkage are reviewed. This provides an intuitive vision for future semiconductor engineering architectures that integrate diverse functions while increasing computational speed.
